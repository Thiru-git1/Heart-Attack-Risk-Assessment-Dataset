# Heart-Attack-Risk-Assessment-Dataset
Dataset using vitals and biomarkers to assess heart attack risk levels.

About Dataset
This dataset was collected at Zheen Hospital in Erbil, Iraq, from January to May 2019. It includes medical records of patients with the aim of classifying whether an individual had a heart attack. The dataset features key health indicators, useful for diagnosis and risk assessment.

Dataset Attributes

Age
Patient’s age in years. Older individuals are generally at higher risk for cardiovascular issues.

Gender
A binary indicator: • 1 = Male
• 0 = Female
Gender is a relevant factor in heart disease, with risk profiles varying by sex and age.

Heart rate
Heartbeats per minute. Abnormal heart rate can indicate cardiac stress or underlying issues.

Systolic blood pressure
Pressure in arteries during heartbeats. High systolic values are a significant risk factor for heart attacks.

Diastolic blood pressure
Pressure in arteries between heartbeats. Elevated diastolic pressure also contributes to cardiovascular risk.

Blood sugar
Blood glucose level (in mg/dL). While not a binary column, values above 120 mg/dL generally indicate hyperglycemia, which is a risk factor for heart conditions, especially in diabetic patients.

CK-MB Creatine kinase-MB enzyme level, a cardiac biomarker. High levels can indicate heart muscle damage.

Troponin
A protein released into the blood when the heart muscle is damaged. Elevated levels are strongly associated with heart attacks.

Result
Classification of the patient's condition: • positive = The patient experienced a heart attack
• negative = No heart attack detected
This is the target label for classification tasks.

Risk_Level
A categorical assessment of the patient's heart attack risk based on clinical indicators. Possible values include: • Low
• Moderate
• High

Recommendation
Medical or lifestyle advice based on the patient's condition and risk level. Common recommendations include: • Immediate medical attention (for high-risk or confirmed cases)
• Monitor closely and consult doctor (for moderate-risk cases)
• Maintain healthy lifestyle (for low-risk or preventative cases)
